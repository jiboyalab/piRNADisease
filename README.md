# piRNADisease
The benchmark dataset is derived from piRDisease v1.0 (http://www.piwirna2disease.org/index.php) \cite{muhammad2019pirdisease}, 
which contains 7939 known associations between 4796 piRNAs and 28 diseases from manually curated experiments. 
In this study, the detailed dataset we used can be specifically described as follows:
where $ \pi ^{p} $ represents the positive samples containing 5002 association pairs between 4350 piRNAs and 21 diseases, 
$ \pi ^{n} $ represents the negative samples containing the same 5002 association pairs,
which were randomly selected from all the 86348 (4350$\times$21-5002) unidentified piRNA-disease association pairs. Furthermore, the piRNA IDs and sequence information is derived from the piRBase v2.0 (http://www.regulatoryrna.org/database/piRNA/index.html) \cite{2018piRBase,zhang2014pirbase}. The disease semantic information is derived from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) database (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/) \cite{lipscomb2000medical}.
